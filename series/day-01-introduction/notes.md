# Day 01 — CI/CD Series Introduction & Pipeline Design

## 🎯 Objective

Understand what we are building in this series and design a basic CI pipeline at a conceptual level.

---

## 🧭 What We Covered

- Overview of the CI/CD lifecycle
- Problems CI solves in real engineering teams
- High-level pipeline stages
  - Build
  - Test
  - Package
  - Release artifact
- Introduction to the demo Node.js application

---

## 🏗️ Pipeline (Conceptual)

Code Push → Build → Test → Docker Image → Registry

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- CI is about fast feedback and confidence
- Pipelines evolve over time — they are never perfect on day one
- Automation reduces human error and improves reliability

---

## 📌 What’s Next

In Day 02 we will:

- Set up the project locally
- Write a Dockerfile
- Run the application in a container
